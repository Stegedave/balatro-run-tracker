# Balatro Run Analysis

A small python and marimo project to track, read, and analyze my balatro runs from an Excel sheet.
The purpose of this project is to make it easier to read and interpret the data from my excel sheet.

# Overview

- Reads an excel file I maintain containing my balato runs.
- Updated consistently as I play.
- Analyzes the data in Python using pandas.
- Displays the results in a clean, and easy to read format using Marimo.3

It's designed to help me quickly understand my gameplay statistics and patterns without having to use excel for analysis.
